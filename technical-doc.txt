Overview

This document provides a technical overview and test cases for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question and Answer (Q&A) system. The system uses Grok to generate embeddings, retrieve relevant documents, and generate answers for user questions.

1. Application Components

Key Features

Document Ingestion: Accepts documents, generates embeddings, and stores them.

Question Answering (Q&A): Handles user questions, retrieves relevant documents, and generates answers based on context.

Document Selection: Filters the documents used for answering questions.

Technologies

Backend Framework: Flask (Python)

Embedding and Retrieval: Grok Library

Database: Postgres or in-memory data structures for this example

Similarity Metric: Cosine similarity

2. API Endpoints

1. Document Ingestion API

Endpoint: /ingest

Method: POST

Payload:

{
    "title": "Document Title",
    "content": "Document Content"
}

Response:

{
    "message": "Document ingested successfully",
    "embedding": [embedding_vector]
}

2. Q&A API

Endpoint: /qa

Method: POST

Payload:

{
    "question": "User Question",
    "document_ids": [1, 2, 3]
}

Response:

{
    "answer": "Generated Answer"
}

3. Testing Methodology

Test Cases

1. Document Ingestion API

Test ID

Scenario

Input

Expected Output

TC-001

Valid document ingestion

{ "title": "Doc 1", "content": "Sample content" }

{ "message": "Document ingested successfully", "embedding": [embedding_vector] }

TC-002

Missing document title

{ "content": "Sample content" }

{ "error": "Title is required" }

TC-003

Missing document content

{ "title": "Doc 1" }

{ "error": "Content is required" }

TC-004

Empty payload

{}

{ "error": "Invalid request" }

2. Q&A API

Test ID

Scenario

Input

Expected Output

TC-005

Valid question and document IDs

{ "question": "What is this document about?", "document_ids": [1] }

{ "answer": "This is a document about..." }

TC-006

Question without document IDs

{ "question": "What is this document about?" }

{ "error": "Document IDs are required" }

TC-007

Invalid document ID

{ "question": "What is this document about?", "document_ids": [999] }

{ "answer": "No relevant document found." }

TC-008

Missing question

{ "document_ids": [1] }

{ "error": "Question is required" }

TC-009

Empty payload

{}

{ "error": "Invalid request" }

3. Edge Cases

Test ID

Scenario

Input

Expected Output

TC-010

Large document content

{ "title": "Doc 1", "content": "<large_content>" }

{ "message": "Document ingested successfully", "embedding": [embedding_vector] }

TC-011

Multiple document retrieval

{ "question": "What is this document about?", "document_ids": [1, 2, 3] }

{ "answer": "Generated answer based on retrieved documents." }

4. Example Test Case (Postman)

Test Name: Valid Q&A Request

Request

Endpoint: /qa

Method: POST

Payload:

{
    "question": "What is this document about?",
    "document_ids": [1]
}

Expected Response

{
    "answer": "This is a document about requesting leave."
}

Steps:

Open Postman.

Create a new request with the given endpoint and payload.

Send the request and validate the response against the expected output.

5. Technical Implementation Details

Document Ingestion

Purpose: Generate embeddings for documents and store them.

Process:

Accept the document title and content via the API.

Generate an embedding vector using Grok's embed_document method.

Store the document and its embedding in a database (or memory for demo purposes).

Q&A API

Purpose: Retrieve relevant documents based on a question and generate an answer.

Process:

Accept the user question and document IDs via the API.

Generate an embedding for the question using Grok's embed_text method.

Compute similarity scores between the question embedding and document embeddings.

Retrieve the most relevant document and pass it to Grok's generate_answer method to generate a response.

6. Future Improvements

Implement caching for embeddings to improve performance.

Allow batch processing for large datasets.

Extend support for multiple languages using Grok's multilingual capabilities.

Introduce logging and monitoring for production readiness.
